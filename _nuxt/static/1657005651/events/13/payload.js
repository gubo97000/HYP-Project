The Berlin based project takes the electro-driven techno of duo Modeselektor and perfectly combines it with the more subtle, Thom Yorke post-electornica of producer-singer Apparat. I first saw them at BLOC 2011 before they took a break from performing live to focus on their solo careers. They were amazing, propelled by perfect sound and backed by interesting live visuals.","Auditorium Parco della Musica ","Via Pietro de Coubertin, 10, 00196 Roma RM","13-1.webp","13-2.webp","PicturesConnection","Event")));
