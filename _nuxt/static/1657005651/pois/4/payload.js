It has Moorish origins, being the minaret for the former mosque. What’s unusual about the tower is that 34 ramps lead to the top instead of a stairway. This was so that Muezzin who led the call to prayer could ride his horse up the tower instead of walking. To break up the monotony of the climb there are regular archaeological exhibits on the way up. And at the top, the view is even better than you could hope for.",4,"La Giralda","PicturesConnection")));
