It is composed of eight modules on six floors each, with the façade of the module composed of a triple-glass unit slightly curved to the outside. The vertical succession of rounded forms creates a feeling of slight vibration of the volume of the building as it rises upward. Elevations of the short sides are fully glazed and show the mechanical series of six panoramic lifts going up and down to the various floors of the building.","Allianz Tower",4,"PicturesConnection")));
