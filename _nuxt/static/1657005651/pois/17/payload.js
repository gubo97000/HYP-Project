Designed as a lictorian tower in the fascist era, and created by the architect Gio Ponti, it was constructed in just 68 days using special steel pipes. It was reopened for public visits after the restoration carried out by the Distilleria Fratelli Branca, from which it took the name it bears today.  The lift inside the tower takes you up to the belvedere in just under a minute. From there you can enjoy a spectacular view of the park and the entire city, as far as the Alps. The top-to-bottom view of the sculptures positioned above the nearby Arco della Pace (Arch of Peace) is a different experience than seeing them from the ground!","Torre Branca","PicturesConnection")));
