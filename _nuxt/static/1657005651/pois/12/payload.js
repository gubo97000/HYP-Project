You can climb up either by stairs (251 steps to reach the first level) or by elevator. It's the worldâ€™s largest walkable roof of a Gothic cathedral with its 8000 m2 of terraces. An evocative forest of spires, sculptures, and walkways represents the entire world: from elements of nature such as fruits and leaves to historical figures such as the boxer Primo Carnera or the conductor Arturo Toscanini. In the 1930s it even housed a bar! Whilst strolling around take a close look at the details carved in the marble and then glance beyond the spires: breath-taking views open up before your eyes. On one side you can see the Alps and skyscrapers and, on the other, Palazzo Reale, the Museo del Novecento, and the entire city spread out below your eyes.","Duomo terraces",4,"4 hours","Itinerary","PoiItinerary","PicturesConnection")));
