Its name derives from a toponym in use in the area since the mid-20th century, Regio Trivii, referring to the confluence of three streets in the square, or from the triple outlet of the water of the original fountain. The construction of the current Trevi fountain is due to Pope Clement XII who, in 1732, launched a competition in which the major artists of the time participated. Among the various projects presented, the architect, Nicola Salvi was chosen.","Fontana di Trevi","PicturesConnection")));
