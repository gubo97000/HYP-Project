It’s the seat of the Regional Concil of Lombardy. This historic skyscraper, designed by Gio Ponti, looms above the front of the Central Station and welcomes travelers arriving in the city. It was the first building to exceed the height of the Duomo’s Madonnina statue, which traditionally always had to remain the highest point in the city. For this reason, another gold Madonnina statue was placed on the Pirellone roof, a miniature copy of the ‘sister’ (85 cm compared to the 4.16 meter original). In subsequent years all the skyscrapers that exceeded this height underwent the same procedure.","Pirelli Skyscraper","PicturesConnection")));
